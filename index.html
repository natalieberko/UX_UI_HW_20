            <p>Many government agencies find it challenging to build website experiences where information is organized around user needs rather than agency needs. For many of these government websites, the UI design is outdated and the content is very information heavy.</p>

            <p>The National Security Agency (NSA) is an intelligence agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. The NSA leads the U.S. Government in cryptology, the science of making and breaking codes, in order to gain a decision advantage for the nation and our allies under all circumstances. The Central Security Service (CSS), part of NSA, provides cryptologic support, knowledge, and assistance to the military cryptologic community. CSS coordinates and develops policy and guidance on missions of NSA/CSS to ensure military integration.

                <p>I went for a captivating homepage that gives the user a general idea of who the NSA is. I included sections that the user might navigate to with appropriate calls to action. The homepage also reflects the main navigation options.</p>

            <p class="highlight">How might we portray the NSA brand?</p>
            <p>Since I’m designing for a government website, I wanted to keep the design simple and modern and incorporate elements that evoke trust and reliability. The hues of blue inspire these feelings. I also wanted to incorporate images that show the NSA’s values. For example, diversity is an important value of the NSA, so include images that portray a diverse representation of people.</p>

        </div>
        <ul class="conclusion">
            <p class="takeaway">Know your agency. Know your content.</p>
            <p class="mas">I spent a lot of time getting to know the current NSA.gov website before I was able to begin the responsive redesign. I realized I had to really understand the content before I reorganized it. In addition, I struggled to get an understanding of who the NSA is so I spent a lot of time doing research about the agency in order to get a true sense of the brand I wanted to convey.</p>
            <p class="mas">The heuristic evaluation and navigation annotations really helped me realize the changes I needed to make in the redesign.</p>
            <p class="takeaway">Working with components.</p>
            <p class="mas">This is the first time I’ve worked with components and they truly are a game changer. They saved me a lot of time and I felt the whole design process went a lot smoother. I was able to keep my designs and iterations consistent and make changes very easily.</p>
            <p class="takeaway">The future of this redesign.</p>
            <p class="mas">I am looking forward to continue working on this redesign. Based on the feedback I received from user tests, I intend to:</p>
            <ul class="futureDesign">
                <li class="mas item-list">Make sure to clearly define everything so users aren’t confused. For example, users weren’t sure what CSS meant (it means Central Security Services).</li>
                <li class="mas item-list">Refine the sitemap and navigation to include menu options that flow better.</li>
                <li class="mas item-list">Design the contact form with drop down menus</li>
                <li class="mas item-list">Use images to better communicate to the user what they may expect to find in that section.</li>
                <li class="mas item-list">Design more responsive pages across more modalities, such as tablet.</li>
                <li class="mas item-list">Include warning pop up messages whenever users must leave the site.</li>
            </ul>
