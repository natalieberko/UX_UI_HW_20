            <p>Many government agencies find it challenging to build website experiences where information is organized around user needs rather than agency needs. For many of these government websites, the UI design is outdated and the content is very information heavy.</p>
            <p>I was tasked with a responsive redesign of the information architecture, interface, branding, and assets of the current NSA website in order to improve its usability. </p>

            <p>The National Security Agency (NSA) is an intelligence agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. The NSA leads the U.S. Government in cryptology, the science of making and breaking codes, in order to gain a decision advantage for the nation and our allies under all circumstances. The Central Security Service (CSS), part of NSA, provides cryptologic support, knowledge, and assistance to the military cryptologic community. CSS coordinates and develops policy and guidance on missions of NSA/CSS to ensure military integration.

                <p>I went for a captivating homepage that gives the user a general idea of who the NSA is. I included sections that the user might navigate to with appropriate calls to action. The homepage also reflects the main navigation options.</p>

                <p>For my solution to the overcrowded submenus, I organized the content in 2nd and 3rd level pages with sections. This way, users aren’t exposed to too much information yet  they can choose to learn more if they wish. I also made sure to include breadcrumbs so users know where they are within the site.</p>

            <h4>Visual Design and Branding</h4>
            <p class="highlight">How might we portray the NSA brand?</p>
            <p>Since I’m designing for a government website, I wanted to keep the design simple and modern and incorporate elements that evoke trust and reliability. The hues of blue inspire these feelings. I also wanted to incorporate images that show the NSA’s values. For example, diversity is an important value of the NSA, so include images that portray a diverse representation of people.</p>
